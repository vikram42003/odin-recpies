    <h2>Best Cheese for Grilled Cheese</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar but feel free to use sharp Cheddar,  mild Cheddar, or a blend of both.
        Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American Cheese. Other delicious options are Gruyere, Brie, Fontana, Gouda, Pepper Jack and Havarati
    </p>

    <h2>Best Bread for Grilled Cheese</h2>
    <p>This recipe calls for plain white sandwich bread. You could also use sourdough, brioche, or even ciabatta. You can really make grilled cheese with any type of bread you like, but you should make sure the loaf is sturdy enough to handle the heat. Thinly sliced, delicate breads will quickly fall apart.</p>
